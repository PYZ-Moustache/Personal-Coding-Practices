# this is the function definition; it has two parameters, an expression doing calculations and a return
def f_calc_gear_ratio(p_drive_gear, p_driven_gear):
    gear_ratio = p_driven_gear / p_drive_gear  # this is just a simple expression we learned in Chapter 2.
    return gear_ratio  # returning a value is the most common purpose for a function

# let's give the user input variables a default value before we enter a loop
user_drive_gear = 0
user_driven_gear = 0

# maybe we'd like a counter
counter = 0

# getting input from the user is always better with a while loop because we don't know how many passes we will make
while user_drive_gear >= 0:
    counter += 1  # [FIXED] increment the counter variable here at the top of the loop
    user_drive_gear = int(input('Please enter the drive gear tooth count (-1 to exit):\n'))
    if user_drive_gear < 0:  # if the user wants to exit, we break out of the loop without getting the 2nd value
        break
    user_driven_gear = int(input('Please enter the driven gear tooth count:\n'))  # [FIXED] get the driven gear from the user here
    gear_ratio = f_calc_gear_ratio(user_drive_gear, user_driven_gear) # [FIXED]
    print(f'Drive Gear has {user_drive_gear} teeth Driven gear has {user_driven_gear} teeth for an effective gear ratio of {gear_ratio:.2f}') # [FIXED]
print(f'Thank you for using the gear ratio calculator, you have completed {counter} calculations') # [FIXED]
